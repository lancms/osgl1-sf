- Fix the lang-system:
+ Not everything is translated (who the hell was stupid enough to hardcode the language into Norwegian?)

-Add following features:
+Canteen (should be possible to use most of the code from my existing system, but I'm not ready to give out the source for it yet [want to have the databases to make stats of])
** Think I might write this in soon **
+Forum (needs complete rewrite)
+Task-list (admins might like to add tasks that has to be done, and assign it to somebody).
** Done: LAK **
+Logging (everything should be logged)
** backend-system written, only need to write in logging of everything + make a frontend **
+Stats (need a complete rewrite)
** Basic frontend written for visitors OS.

+Seatmap (should have fallback to tables if PHP-GD isn't installed)


# Wannabe
## lists.sf.net doesn't like me, this is supposed to be sent to the devel-list, but it friggin' won't! --Mathias
+ "Do you like this wannabe?" should be seperated from comments!
+ Show "Do I like this wannabe?" and "Have I commented this wannabe?" in the list of users.
+ Perhaps the UserID in the list of users should point to their profile instead?
