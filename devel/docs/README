### OSGlobeLAN ###

http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/osglobelan

## Introduction ##

First of all, this is _not_ a finished release.
There are bugs, lacking features and unfinished documentation.

This project was started by Lars Åge (laaknor) and Jarle (cronoman) sometime to fill the need for a registration system for GlobeLAN.
[This is a guess, I have no idea, actually... Historic input, Lars Åge? :-) [FIXME]]

The project has grown, so has the team working on it, and a SourceForge project was started to make the project public and to manage it properly.
