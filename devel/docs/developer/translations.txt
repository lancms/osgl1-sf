Every string you write that is to be echo'ed out to the user, or anything else, is to be written with translations. Thei is the way you do this:

lang("string to be translated", "module", "descripsion of the string");

this functions returns a value, so if you are to write it out, you have to "echo lang();".



These are the modules that will be used:
admin_index 		// The admin.php file
admin_<file> 		// File in admin/-subdirecory
inc_<file> 		// file in inc/-subdirectory


/* Add more as they come */


// FIXME: Add a note about how the heck we translate these strings...
