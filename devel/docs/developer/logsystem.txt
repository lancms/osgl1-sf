This is the syntax of the dblog()-function:


dblog(numeric string to show what kind of log this is, logText, oldLog[not really needed, but if you change something; use it]);

it always logs what IP a user comes from, timestamp (UNIX) and also what userID it is.


Here are the numeric strings for what is logged:

0 = default in DB, something probably happened wrong in query().
1 = default in dblog(), someone probably left out the type.
2 = session start, syntax: "sID:::HTTP_REFERER"
3 = user came with old session, removed. syntax: "old sID:::HTTP_REFERER"
4 = user logged in. syntax: "sID" // We log sID to be able to track a users movement.
5 = user logged out. syntax: "sID" // same as above.
6 = User registered. syntax: sID:::username:::email:::name:::verificationcode:::street:::postNr:::postPlace:::cellphone:::birthDAY:::birthMONTH:::birthYEAR
