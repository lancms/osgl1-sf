### Installation instructions ###

http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/osglobelan

## Latest version ##

You should be using the latest version of OSGlobeLAN.
We haven't yet released any files, but you should get the current version from CVS.

Remember to check the bugtracker for known bugs and so on.


## Requirements ##

We haven't done any extended testing of what versions of this software OSGlobeLAN runs on, but this is what we create and tests it on:

* PHP4	- It could work with PHP5 too, but we haven't tested. Needs MySQL- and GD-support. (php4-mysql and php4-gd)
* Apache	- Or some other webserver that support PHP.
* MySQL	- Some stable version of MySQL 3 should work just fine.

If you don't get it going on the above, or if you get it working on something else, please let us know.
