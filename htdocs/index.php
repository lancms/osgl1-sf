<h2>About OSGlobeLAN</h2>

<p><b>The original description:</b> A LAN-party organizing system. Has seatregistration, composignup, polls, support for multiple designs and much more. The system is primarily used by <a class='link' href='http://www.globelan.net'>GlobeLAN</a>, but we try to make it as useable as possible for other parties too.</p>


<p><b>Current version: </b>
<br />We have released some alphas of OSGL2. GlobeLAN is currently using the svn trunk for it's website.
<ul>
	<li>Latest OSGL2 release on <a href='https://sourceforge.net/projects/osglobelan/files/osglobelan-tng/'>SourceForge</a>
	<li>SVN available on <a class='link' href='http://sourceforge.net/svn/?group_id=77474'>SourceForge</a></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><b>Old versions: </b>
<br />We no longer support the old releases called "devel" or "osgl1". We've not touched this code in a long time, and it's considered obsolete.
</p>


<p><b>Getting started: </b>
<br />The documentation available for OSGL2 is placed in the docs/ folder inside the release.
</p>

<p><b>Developers:</b> Lars &Aring;ge "Laaknor" Kamfjord is the main developer and the guy with most of the ideas. He's supported by Mathias "Alfa" B&oslash;hn Grytemark and from time to time other people from within the GlobeLAN-community. If you would like to help, send us an <a class='link' href='http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=77474'>email</a>.</p>
