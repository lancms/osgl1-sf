<h2>About OSGlobeLAN</h2>

<p><b>The original description:</b> A LAN-party organizing system. Has seatregistration, composignup, polls, support for multiple designs and much more. The system is primarily used by <a class='link' href='http://www.globelan.net'>GlobeLAN</a>, but we try to make it as useable as possible for other parties too.</p>

<p><b>Current version: </b>
<br />Development of the 1.0 codebase have been halted, only serious security issues will be fixed.
<br />We have started OSGL2 (OSGlobeLAN2), but we don't have a release or fully working featureset yet.
<ul>
	<li>Version 0.9: Available on <a class='link' href='http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=77474'>SourceForge</a>.</li>
	<li>Nightly snapshot of the 1.0 codebase: Available <a class='link' href='http://download.globelan.net/devel_snapshot.tar.bz2'>here</a>.</li>
	<li>SVN readonly for OSGL2: Available on <a class='link' href='http://sourceforge.net/svn/?group_id=77474'>SourceForge</a>.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><b>Developers:</b> Lars &Aring;ge "Laaknor" Kamfjord is the main developer and the guy with most of the ideas. He's supported by Mathias "Alfa" B&oslash;hn Grytemark and from time to time other people from within the GlobeLAN-community.
